# PerW E-commerce & Warehouse Management System - Implementation Complete

## Project Overview
We have successfully implemented the foundational structure for the PerW e-commerce and warehouse management system using Laravel. The system is designed to handle both administrative tasks (using MVC with Blade templates) and customer-facing operations (using Vue.js with RESTful API).

## Completed Components

### 1. Database Layer
- **22 Migration Files** created for all required tables:
  - Core data: Roles, Users, Addresses, Categories, Suppliers
  - Product management: Products, ProductVariants, ProductImages
  - Inventory management: Warehouses, Inventories, InventoryTransactions
  - Order processing: Carts, CartDetails, PurchaseOrders, PurchaseOrderDetails

  - Support for hierarchical categories
  - Multi-warehouse inventory management

### 3. Factories & Seeders
- **9 Factory Classes** for generating test data
- **2 Seeder Classes** for populating the database:
  - BasicPerWSeeder: Minimal data for system operation
  - PerWDatabaseSeeder: Comprehensive sample data with relationships

### 4. API Layer
- **RESTful Controller** for products (ProductController)
- **API Routes** configured with resource routing
- Ready for Vue.js frontend integration

### 5. Admin Interface
- **Dashboard Controller** for administrative functions
